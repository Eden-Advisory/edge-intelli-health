## Implementation Notes

The metrics framework above establishes quantifiable targets across four critical domains:

1. Technical Performance validates the core capabilities of the ICP monitoring system, ensuring accuracy and reliability meet military medical requirements.

2. Clinical Performance measures focus on the system's effectiveness in real-world medical scenarios, with emphasis on rapid and accurate detection of critical conditions.

3. Operational Performance addresses the practical aspects of field deployment, including ease of use and resilience in austere environments.

4. Regulatory and Compliance metrics ensure the system meets all necessary standards for military medical devices while maintaining data security and privacy.

Each metric includes:
- A specific, measurable target
- A defined testing methodology
- Clear validation criteria

This comprehensive framework supports both the development process and eventual FDA clearance by providing objective measures of system performance and effectiveness.

### Reporting and Review

Performance against these metrics should be:
- Tracked continuously during development
- Reviewed monthly by the project team
- Reported quarterly to stakeholders
- Formally assessed before phase transitions
- Included in FDA submission documentation

### Updates and Revisions

This metrics framework should be reviewed and updated:
- At the completion of each development phase
- When new military requirements are identified
- Following significant technical changes
- Based on field testing feedback

Any changes to metrics must be documented and approved by relevant stakeholders, including military medical leadership and regulatory advisors.
